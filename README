DISA STIG Scripts to harden a system to the RHEL 6 STIG.

These scripts will harden a system to specifications that
are based upon the the following previous hardening 
provided by the following projects:

CONTENT
=======

Scritps are designed to run out of /opt/stig-fix/ on a perferably fresh
installation of RHEL 6.4+ (RHEL 6.4 updated pam_lastlog.so to disable 
incative users.)

apply.sh - master script that runs scripts in cat1-cat4 and misc
toggle_nousb.sh - toggles the 'nousb' kernel flag only
toggle_udf.sh - toggles 'udf' mounting of DVDs (USGCB Blacklists udf) 
toggle_usb.sh - toggles 'nousb' kernel flag and the mass storage kernel module
config - Directory with some pre-STIGed configurations (auditd,iptables,system-auth-local,etc.) 
cat1 - CAT I STIG Scripts
cat2 - CAT II STIG Scripts
cat3 - CAT III STIG Scripts
cat4 - CAT IV STIG Scripts
misc - NSA SNAC, GNOME, and Other miscellenous lockdown scripts
manual - Manaully run (There be dragons here)
backups - Backup copy of modified files to compare and restore configurations

Run is logged in /var/log/stig-fix-YYYY-MM-DD.log

HOWTO
=====

   1. Hardening the BIOS configuration (Disable USB Booting, set administrative passwords, etc.)
   2. Enable Drive Encryption (LUKS on your LVM VG or Hardware-based FIPS 140-2 compliant)
   3. Partitioning the system to minimally include the following:

          /boot
          swap
          /
          /home
          /tmp
          /var
          /var/log
          /var/log/audit
          /var/www (Optional, Web Servers)
          /rhnsat (Optional, RHN Satellite)
          /opt (Optional, Commercial Applications)

   4. Select a GRUB password (SHA512, using grub-crypt or during Install)
   5. Install a minimal installation (include rsyslog, ntp, aide, scrub, vlock, screen, logwatch, openswan, openscap, openscap-utils, dracut-fips)
   6. Register a system with a patch server - either a disconnected RHN Satellite or local/web-based (preferably SSL) repository:

          Kickstart can register a system with rhnreg_ks --activationkey="<KEY>"
          With a disconnected RHN Satellite, be sure to include the proper /etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date configuration and SSL Certificate
          For a local or web-based repository, create a .repo file in /etc/yum.repos.d/

                         # vi /etc/yum.repos.d/rhel-dvd.repo

                                                  [rhel-dvd]
                                                  name=Red Hat Enterprise Linux $releasever - $basearch - DVD
                                                  baseurl=file:///media/
                                                  enabled=1
                                                  gpgcheck=1
                                                  gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release

                         # mount /dev/dvd /media
                         # yum clean all
                         # yum update

          For a repository, synchronize patches via a RHEL system connected to the Public RHN:

                        To synchronize a channel with only the newest packages, use the following command:

                                   # reposync -n -l -p <directory> -repoid=’<channel>’

                        To synchronize an entire channel, use the following command:

                                   # reposync -l -p <directory> -repoid=’<channel>’

                         After the packages have been downloaded into the directory in the previous step, create a repository with the RPMs.

                                   # createrepo <directory>

                         To export the directory, create an ISO image from the directory to burn to DVD:

                                   # mkisofs -RJ -o repo-export.iso <directory>

   7. Include the stig-fix scirpts in the Kickstart and run the configuration '/sbin/stig-fix -q &> /dev/null' in the %post section  -OR- install the RPM afterwards and run manually (/sbin/stig-fix)
   8. Configure NTP (/etc/ntp.conf) for the local time sources (or military ones) that are approved
   9. Configure Syslog forwarding (/etc/rsyslog.conf) to a local rsyslog instance (or Splunk as the case may be)
  10. Add users with root access to the 'wheel' group, for users with ssh access add them to the 'sshusers' group.
  11. Review the manual scripts in (/opt/stig-fix/manual) - putting the kernel in FIPS 140-2 mode can cause various weaker authentication not to work (e.g. RHN Satellite is still using md5)
  12. The following scripts have been included for convenience:

          /sbin/toggle_udf.sh (for mounting DVDs)
          /sbin/toggle_usb.sh (for enabling and disabling USB storage)
          /sbin/toggle_nousb.sh (for enabling USB Keyboards that don't work with the 'nousb' kernel option)

  13. Create users:
  
          Remote Access (no ssh without this group)

               # useradd -m -c "Remote User" -G sshusers remoteuser
  
          System Administrator (SA)
               
               # useradd -m -c "System Administrator" -G sshusers,wheel admin
          
          Audit Administrator (AA)
          
               # useradd -m -c "Audit Administrator" -G sshusers,isso auditor
               
          (Optional) After adding SAs to the system, lock the root account:
       
               # passwd -l root

PROJECT WORK
============

- Map DISA STIG RHEL 5 GEN controls to DISA STIG RHEL 6 SRG and NIST 800-53 controls
  (each sub script has an echo block stating what GEN it applies to - adding the SRG
  and NIST controls will help security people to understand what was inteneded during
  the C&A process.

- Help verify the configurations against SSG OpenSCAP Content.

- Add updates to with new security features in RHEL 6.5 and newer
